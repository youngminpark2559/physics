Write phase of wave function in mathematical form
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-NI1EndSnk

$$$\psi = A \times \sin\phi $$$ 

$$$\psi$$$ is wave function 
A is amplitude 

==================================================
Why does phase $$$\phi$$$ become $$$\phi = kx -\omega t$$$? 

==================================================
Notation of wave in physics way is that 
$$$f (x-vt)$$$ 

==================================================
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/physics/master/handel/pics/2019_02_13_16:46:15.png"><xmp>

Above one shows function $$$f(x)$$$ is moved towards right as much as distance $$$s=vt$$$ 

Moved $$$f(x)$$$ can be written as $$$f(x-vt)$$$ 

So, things which can be represented as $$$f(x-vt)$$$ can be considered as wave 

==================================================
$$$\sin 5 meter$$$ doesn't make sense 
$$$\sin 10 seconds$$$ doesn't make sense  
$$$\sin 5kilogram$$$ doesn't make sense  

$$$\pi$$$ in $$$\sin\pi$$$ should have just number 

==================================================
You had used $$$(x-vt)$$$ as kind of distance from above example 

You can use k to remove unit to use $$$(x-vt)$$$ inside of $$$\sin$$$ 
$$$\sin k(x-vt)$$$

==================================================
wavelength is most important characteristic 
and most important physical quantities in wave 

wavelength is very physical quantities which are related to periodicity of wave 

==================================================
If you pass $$$x+\lambda$$$ into $$$x$$$ from $$$\sin k(x-vt)$$$ 
value of $$$\sin k(x-vt)$$$ shoudln't change 

To achieve this, you should have $$$k\lambda = 2\pi$$$ 

Therefore, $$$k=\dfrac{2\pi}{\lambda}$$$ 

k is called wave number 

==================================================
$$$v = \dfrac{\lambda}{T} = f \lambda$$$

$$$\lambda$$$ is wavelength 
$$$T$$$ is one period 
$$$v$$$ is phase velocity of wave 
$$$f$$$ is number of vibrations 

Therefore, $$$kv = \dfrac{2\pi}{\lambda} \times f\lambda$$$ 
and finally $$$kv=2\pi f$$$ 

==================================================
$$$kv$$$ is called angular frequency $$$\omega$$$
