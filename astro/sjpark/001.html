Third day of third lunar month
Tano

Thanksgiving

# ======================================================================
Phases of moon: DOC in northern areas
waxing crescent moon -> full moon -> waning moon

In southern areas (Australia, Africa), it's COD order

# ======================================================================
Locations of each moon when sun disappears and appears
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/physics/master/pics/2018_12_08_16:07:35.png"><xmp>

1. new moon (at the first week of month)
2. waxing crescent moon
3. full moon
4. waning moon
5. old moon (at the last week of month)

# ======================================================================
New moon: 
When sun is in the sky, moon is not brigth because sun makes sky bright
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/physics/master/pics/2018_12_08_16:09:34.png"><xmp>

When sun starts to set, sky becomes dark
In first week of month, moon is located near to sun
So, moon takes sunlight partially,
as if when you move hand to flash light, your hand takes partial light.
So, moon looks new moon shape
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/physics/master/pics/2018_12_08_16:10:21.png"><xmp>

# ======================================================================
When sun starts to set at 18:00, waxing crescent moon is located in highest southern area
Sun light lays down onto moon from side and far direction of the sun
So, waxing crescent moon brights in half

Waxing crescent moon starts to rise at 12:00 when sun is in highest southern area
but waxing crescent moon is not bright at 12:00 because sky is too bright due to existing sun
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/physics/master/pics/2018_12_08_16:23:13.png"><xmp>

Waxing crescent moon starts to show at 18:00 when sun starts to set
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/physics/master/pics/2018_12_08_16:17:13.png"><xmp>

Waxing crescent moon sets at 00:00

So, when army builds strategy where army wants to have moon light when they move, 
and army doesn't want to have moon light when they start to attack,
army needs to choose period when waxing crescent moon shows.
Specifically, 7 or 8th day as lunar calendar

# ======================================================================
Note that, new moon can't show in highest southern area in the sky as if waxing crescent moon is located at 18:00.

Since new moon is located in near to to sun, 
when sun disappears, new moon also disappears after showing in short time at early evening and night

So, specifically, you can't see new moon after 22:00

If you read novel where 2 samurais duel at 00:00 with having new moon in the sky,
it doesn't actually make sense because new moon can't show after 22:00

# ======================================================================
Full moon
When sun sets, moon is located in opposite position to sun
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/physics/master/pics/2018_12_08_16:32:26.png"><xmp>
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/physics/master/pics/2018_12_08_16:33:02.png"><xmp>

So, full moon starts to show when sun starts to set
Then full moon shows high in the night
Full moon sets when sun rises in the morning

So, if you need to move in the night with moon light, 
you need to choose period when full moon shows

# ======================================================================
Waning moon

Waning moon rises and starts to show at 00:00
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/physics/master/pics/2018_12_08_16:35:53.png"><xmp>

When sun rises at 6:00, waning moon is located in highest southern area 
(but waning moon is not bright moon due to sun)
</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/physics/master/pics/2018_12_08_16:36:41.png"><xmp>

At 12:00, not bright waning moon sets

# ======================================================================
Old moon

</xmp><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youngminpark2559/physics/master/pics/2018_12_08_16:40:13.png"><xmp>

In old moon peirod, there is no moon in the night sky.
When sun starts to show at 6:00, old moon shows for short time, 
and soon, it becomes not bright moon in the sky
