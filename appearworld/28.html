@ Tree of "forces"

@ Quark has 3 colors.
If 3 colors are summed, it becomes transparent.
Only in transparent state, quarks stays in stable.

@ Red u quark. Yellow u quark. Blue u quark.
Red d quark. Yellow d quark. Blue d quark.

@ Medium particle for forces which are applied between u quark and u quark is "gluon"
Medium particle for forces which are applied between d quark and d quark is "gluon"

"Gluon" changes color of quarks.
Quantum mechanics about changing color of quark is QCD.

Quantum dynamics is composed of "Quantum Eletro Dynamics" and "QCD".

@ Medium particles for forces which change quark into u quark and d quark are $W^{+}, W^{-}$ particles.

@ Medium particles for forces which are applied inside of u quark are $Z_{0}$, photon particles.

@ In above illustration, top-right model is permions. And left model is lapton.

The most stable ones in lapton group are muon $\mu$ and electron e.

Medium particles for forces which are applied between muon and electron are W particle.

@ Muon can affect muon itself with force. And that force is passed by $Z_{0}$ particle.

Electron can affect electron itself with force. And that force is passed by $Z_{0}^{\gamma}$ particle.

@ Important knowledge about both strong interation and weak interation are done with above one illustration.

@ (Not precise) Gravity is equation (which describes curvature of universe-time-space which is material-energy system) based on general relativity theory.

@ One of predictions of general relativity theory is "gravity wave"

@ Particles in standard model.

@ Standard model.

@ Basic particles: permion, lapton.
What enables interactions: boson (boson of integer-times of spin, permion of half-integer-times of spin)

@ When you express standard model in terms of particles per generation.

@ 1st generation particles: has much energy, most stable, what we generally see in particles is almost 1st generation particles.
2nd, 3rd generation particles are intervened in extremly short process.
From 1st generation particles, not-found particle is higgs boson particle. (but not it's found at CERN)

@ Higgs boson is medium particle which mediated forces which made "spontaneous symmetric collapse" from perfect symmetry at bigbang time.
Researchers let proton and proton to collide in LHC (Large Hardron Collider).
They will perform experiments for finding higgs particle in huge detector caled Atlas.

@ All particles have corresponding anit-particles.

At initial time of bigbang, there were particle and anti-particle in same places. But soon particle and anti-particle had been changed into photon.

There were more particles as 1/10 billion times than anti-particles.
That's why all particles and anti-particles offset each other, and the remainders have been remaining until now.

@ Idea of anti-particle had come from "Dirac equation".
"Dirac equation" is what Schr√∂dinger equation (quantum dynamics) and general relativity theory (relativity theory) are merged.

When you solve dirac equation, you obtain 4 solutions.

@ 2 is for spin up, spin down.
